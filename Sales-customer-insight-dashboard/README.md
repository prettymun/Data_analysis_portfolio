# Sales & Customer Insights Dashboard

## Project Overview
An end-to-end data analysis project focused on identifying revenue drivers and customer retention risks for a global B2B firm. This dashboard translates 300+ sales records into actionable business strategies.

## Key Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Data Cleaning & Engineering:** Created engagement bins and geospatial mappings using Python/Google Sheets.
* **Visualization:** Built an interactive Looker Studio dashboard focusing on executive-level KPIs.
* **Statistical Insights:** Conducted segment-specific analysis to identify a 4.1-point satisfaction gap between New and Returning customers.

## Data Structure
The analysis is based on the `sales_customer_insights_cleaned.csv` dataset, which includes:
- **Revenue/Profit:** Financial performance metrics.
- **Engagement:** Last engagement days and customer satisfaction scores.
- **Demographics:** Regional and segmental data (Enterprise, SMB, Public Sector).

## Top 3 Business Findings
1. **The Retention Gap:** Returning customers report an 8.8/10 satisfaction score, while New customers report 4.7/10, highlighting a critical onboarding bottleneck.
2. **Engagement Risk:** 32% of the customer base is in the "Danger Zone" (31–60 days without contact).
3. **Sector Trends:** SMBs are primarily Software-driven, while the Public Sector remains Hardware-heavy with untapped software cross-sell potential.
