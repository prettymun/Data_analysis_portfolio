# Strategic Business Insights & Recommendations

## 1. Customer Retention & Satisfaction Gap
* **The Data:** Returning customers maintain an elite satisfaction score of **8.8/10**, while New customers report a significantly lower average of **4.7/10**.
* **The Insight:** Our core product and service offerings have high "stickiness" and long-term value. However, the initial onboarding phase is a major friction point.
* **Recommendation:** Conduct a deep-dive audit of the first 30 days of the customer journey, specifically for leads originating from **Social Media**, which showed the lowest satisfaction scores.

## 2. Revenue Sustainability Analysis
* **The Data:** **62.3%** of total revenue is currently generated by New customers.
* **The Insight:** While acquisition is high—indicating effective marketing via LinkedIn and Email campaigns—the business is currently reliant on a "leaky bucket" model. 
* **Recommendation:** Implement a dedicated Customer Success program to bridge the transition from "New" to "Returning." Converting just 10% more New customers into Returning ones would significantly reduce the Cost of Acquisition (CAC) and stabilize long-term margins.

## 3. Engagement & Churn Risk
* **The Data:** The largest customer segment (**32%**) falls into the **31–60 day** engagement window.
* **The Insight:** This 30-to-60-day period is the critical "danger zone." Once a customer passes 60 days without contact, the likelihood of churn increases.
* **Recommendation:** Deploy an automated re-engagement trigger in the CRM at the **31-day mark**. Prioritizing this "warm" group is more cost-effective than attempting to win back "stale" customers in the 60+ day category.

## 4. Product-Segment Alignment
* **The Data:** **SMBs** are the primary drivers of Software revenue, whereas the **Public Sector** spends nearly double on Hardware compared to Software.
* **The Insight:** The Public Sector is our least satisfied group but our biggest hardware buyer. They are acquiring physical assets but lack the software integration to maximize their value.
* **Recommendation:** Develop a "Public Sector Modernization Bundle" that attaches software management tools to hardware sales. This will likely improve Public Sector satisfaction scores by increasing the utility of their purchases.
