**Coffee Shop Sales Analysis â€“ Excel Project**

**Project Overview**

This project simulates a coffee shop dataset and demonstrates advanced Excel data analysis techniques. The dataset is structured across three sheets (Orders, Customers, and Products) with 1000 rows each, representing sales transactions, customer information, and product details.

The primary goal of this project is to clean, transform, and analyze raw transactional data using Excel functions, pivot tables, and dashboards to generate meaningful insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends.

ðŸ›  Tools & Techniques Used

XLOOKUP â€“ to populate missing values (e.g., fetching Customer Name and Product details into the Orders sheet).

INDEX-MATCH â€“ as an alternative lookup approach for flexible data referencing.

Mathematical Algorithms â€“ calculating totals, averages, unit conversions, and profit margins.

Multiple IF Statements â€“ classifying orders (e.g., Paid/Not Paid) and handling complex conditions.

Date Formatting â€“ converting and standardizing dates for analysis (monthly/quarterly trends).

Number Formatting â€“ applying currency, percentages, and custom number formats for clarity.

Duplicate Checks â€“ ensuring data integrity across Orders, Customers, and Products.

Converting Ranges to Tables â€“ improving structure, filtering, and formula consistency.

Pivot Tables â€“ summarizing sales by customer, product, and region.

Dashboard Creation â€“ an interactive Excel dashboard to visualize KPIs (e.g., total sales, top products, and top customers).
